Right now, all the Books data would be stored as a dictionary present in 'mock_inventory_db.py'.
The key of the dict is the isbn of every book, and value is the book object containing various attributes of the book.
All the db operations (like add, fetch, etc. ) are defined in the 'db_operations.py' file.
